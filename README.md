# Catan IQ
A client for https://colonist.io to track your opponents resource cards / available buildings, and the remaining resource / development cards of the bank.

## How to run?
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `flutter run`
3. Wait until both Chrome and the App opens
4. Join a game lobby on https://colonist.io (Do not start the game without a lobby phase, that feature is not yet implemented)
5. Start the game and enjoy! (Monitoring window can be interacted with / zoomed at will)

## Known issues

- [ ] Players leaving during the lobby phase will still remain in the game
- [ ] Win screens are untested
- [ ] Colors of players need to be implemented
- [ ] Icons of materials and buildings need to be implemented
